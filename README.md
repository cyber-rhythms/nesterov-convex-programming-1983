# nesterov-convex-programming-1983

The following repository contains my work-in-progress, computer-assisted English translation of the following paper, originally published in Russian:

[Nesterov, Y. E. (1983). A method of solving a convex programming problem with convergence rate O(1/k^2). (Russian). *Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, 269*(3), 543â€“547.](http://www.mathnet.ru/php/archive.phtml?wshow=paper&jrnid=dan&paperid=46009&option_lang=eng)

Some remarks about the rationale for undertaking to upload an English translation of this paper. My studies in deep learning covered an extremely well-known technique known as *Nesterov's accelerated gradient method*, which originated in the above paper. While this paper is freely available and easily accessible online at the above link, it is in Russian.

According to this thread at MathOverflow, an English translation of this paper exists as:

Nesterov, Yu. E. A method of solving a convex programming problem with convergence rate 0(1/k2). (English. Russian original) Zbl 0535.90071 Sov. Math., Dokl. 27, 372-376 (1983); translation from Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 269, 543-547 (1983).

And it is available through interlibrary loan. However, this is difficult for me to get hold of where I live.

In spite of having had a fair number of citations, as well as a strong influence on the convex optimisation and deep learning literature, it seems a strange state of affairs that this paper is not available in English online.

This repository aims to remedy that state of affairs.
