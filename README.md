# nesterov-convex-programming-1983

The following repository contains my work-in-progress, computer-assisted English translation of the following paper, originally published in Russian:

[Nesterov, Y. E. (1983). A method of solving a convex programming problem with convergence rate O(1/k^2). (Russian). *Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, 269*(3), 543â€“547.](http://www.mathnet.ru/php/archive.phtml?wshow=paper&jrnid=dan&paperid=46009&option_lang=eng)

Some remarks about the rationale for undertaking to upload an English translation of this paper. My studies in deep learning covered an extremely well-known technique known as *Nesterov's accelerated gradient method*, which originated in the above paper. While this paper is freely available and easily accessible online at the above link, it is in Russian. According to this thread at MathOverflow, an Enlish translation of this paper exists as:

Nesterov, Yu. E. A method of solving a convex programming problem with convergence rate 0(1/k2). (English. Russian original) Zbl 0535.90071 Sov. Math., Dokl. 27, 372-376 (1983); translation from Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 269, 543-547 (1983).

For those wanting to read this paper in English, sourcing an English paper is possible, but not easy. According to this thread on MathOverflow, it is possible to get a physical
